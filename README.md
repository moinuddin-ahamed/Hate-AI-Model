This project focuses on detecting hate speech in textual data using a fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. Hate speech detection is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP), especially for promoting healthier online communication and flagging harmful content.

🔍 Overview:

Preprocess and clean text data
Tokenize and encode input using BERT tokenizer
Fine-tune a pretrained BERT model on a labeled hate speech dataset
Evaluate performance using standard classification metrics

🚀 Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Transformers (Hugging Face)
PyTorch
Scikit-learn
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

🧠 Model
The model is based on bert-base-uncased, fine-tuned for binary classification (Hate vs. Not Hate). The BERT embeddings allow for deep semantic understanding, which improves detection accuracy compared to traditional methods.

📊 Evaluation
Evaluation metrics include:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
Confusion Matrix
